# webanalyze

This is a port of [Wappalyzer](https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer) in Go. This tool is designed to be performant and allows to test huge lists of hosts.

## Installation and usage

    $ go get -u github.com/rverton/webanalyze/...
    $ webanalyze -update # loads new apps.json file from wappalyzer project
    $ webanalyze -h
    Usage of webanalyze:
      -apps string
            app definition file. (default "apps.json")
      -crawl int
            links to follow from the root page (default 0)
      -host string
            single host to test
      -hosts string
            filename with hosts, one host per line.
      -output string
            output format (stdout|csv|json) (default "stdout")
      -search
            searches all urls with same base domain (i.e. example.com and sub.example.com) (default true)
      -update
            update apps file
      -worker int
            number of worker (default 4)


The `-update` flags downloads a current version of apps.json from the [wappalyzer repository](https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer) to the current folder.
